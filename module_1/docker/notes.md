# Introduction to docker

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. It is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

While shipping applications in docker, we can include all the application code, configuration and dependencies into a container and can execute it any where.

Benefits:
1. Reproducibility
2. Local experiments
3. Integration test (CI/CD)
4. Running pipelines on the cloud
5. Version and update management
6. Spark
7. Serverless
